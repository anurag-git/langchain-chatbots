# Environment Variables Security Guide

## Critical Security Considerations

### 1. Secret Management
- **Never commit `.env` files to version control**
- Use secret management services in production (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Rotate API keys and secrets regularly (every 90 days minimum)

### 2. Production Environment Variables

#### Required Changes for Production:
MUST change these for production
APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
API_KEY_REQUIRED=true
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
ENCRYPT_LOGS=true
CORS_ENABLED=false # or restrict to specific origins


#### Strong Password/Key Requirements:
- `SECRET_KEY`: 32+ character random string
- `API_KEY`: Strong, unique API key (64+ characters recommended)
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Exactly 32 characters for AES encryption
- All database passwords: 16+ characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols

### 3. Environment-Specific Files

#### Development (`.env.development`)
- Use local services (SQLite, local Redis)
- Enable debugging features
- Relaxed security settings

#### Staging (`.env.staging`)
- Mirror production security settings
- Use staging databases
- Enable monitoring and alerts

#### Production (`.env.production`)
- Maximum security settings
- External managed services
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Regular backups

### 4. Docker Secrets
For Docker deployments, use Docker Secrets instead of environment variables for sensitive data:

docker-compose.yml
secrets:
db_password:
external: true
api_key:
external: true


### 5. Validation Checklist
- [ ] All API keys are valid and active
- [ ] Database connections work
- [ ] Redis/cache connections work
- [ ] All external services are accessible
- [ ] Logging directories exist and are writable
- [ ] Backup storage is configured and accessible
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are functional
